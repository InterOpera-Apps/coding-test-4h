# Implementation Documentation

## Project Overview

This implementation delivers a **Multimodal Document Chat System** that processes PDF documents and enables intelligent Q&A conversations. The system extracts text, images, and tables from PDFs, stores them with vector embeddings for semantic search, and provides contextually relevant answers using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) with multimodal support.

**Core Value Proposition:**
- Upload PDF documents and automatically extract structured content
- Ask questions in natural language and receive answers with supporting visual evidence
- Maintain conversation context across multiple turns
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, Groq)

---

## Tech Stack

**Backend:**
- FastAPI (Python 3.11+) - REST API framework
- Docling - PDF parsing and content extraction
- PostgreSQL 15 + pgvector - Vector database for semantic search
- SQLAlchemy - ORM for database operations
- OpenAI API / HuggingFace - Embedding generation
- Multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Ollama, Gemini, Groq)

**Frontend:**

   - Vector search performance degrades with very large collections

4. **LLM Integration**
   - Response quality varies by provider
   - Free providers have rate limits
   - Long conversations may exceed context windows

5. **Frontend**
   - Basic UI implementation
   - No real-time processing updates
